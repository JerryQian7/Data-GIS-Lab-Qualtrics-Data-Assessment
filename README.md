## Qualtrics -  Merging Data

As part of my project to analyze how students use the Data & GIS Lab at Geisel Library, I was given two datasets: LibAnalytics and Qualtrics.
These two datasets originated from different entry tracking softwares, but constituted the data for lab entries over the last few years.

First, I cleaned, dropped, and seleced the correct columns from both datasets. Then I concatenated both datasets into a final working dataset and exported as a .csv file.
